Description:
This repo contains all the files and documentation needed to build a USB-C to UART 2.0 PCB. 
The USB-C is connected to header pins for the UART communication. 
LEDs will indicate, will blink, when the UART communication is actively occuring.

Features:
- QR-Code that links to this repository
- USB-C to UART 2.0
- LED indicator when UART in use
- Hand Solderable
